# fish

I'm trying to track files I need to reproduce this configuration on another
machine. I'm not trying to track everything. As of this writing, I'm tracking
my `config.fish` file, my `fish_plugins` file, and my `conf.d` directory.

## fish_plugins

I've been using [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) to install
plugins for fish. The `fish_plugins` file is generated by Fisher.
