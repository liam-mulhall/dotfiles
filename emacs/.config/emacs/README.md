# Emacs

This might be useful if you ever need to edit Org-mode files. I prefer to use
my own minimalist configuration to Doom Emacs because I know how everything
works in my configuration.

I think the website download of Emacs doesn't work well. Last time I checked,
Homebrew's Emacs also didn't work well. I think maybe the MacPorts version
works okayish.
